# TicTacToe-AI-Solver

This repository contains a command-line TicTacToe game where you can play against an AI opponent. The AI uses the alpha-beta pruning algorithm to determine the optimal moves.

The code has two classes: TicTacToe Class and AI Class

**TicTacToe Class** manages the game state, validates moves, updates the board, and checks for the winner. 

**AI Class** determines the best move using the alpha-beta pruning algorithm.

All functions used during implementation are explained via comments on the [source code](TicTacToe_Game.py).

The other two files in the repository are example runs one is the case when [AI start first](TictacToe_AI_Start.txt) and the other one is when [user start the first](TictacToe_User_Start.txt)
